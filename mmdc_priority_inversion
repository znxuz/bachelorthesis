    participant L as Low Priority Task
    participant Semaphore
    Note over L: Running while holding the semaphore
    Note over H, M: Ready
    L->>H: Schedules task
    H<<-->>Semaphore: Attempts to get the semaphore and fails
    Note over H: Blocked
    H->>M: Schedules task
    Note over M: Blocks Low Priority Task from releasing the semaphore
    Note over M: Thus also blocks High Priority Task -> *Priority Inversion*
    Note over M: Running
    note over M: Done
    M->>L: Schedules task
    Note over L: Running
    Note over L: Done
    L->>Semaphore: Releases the semaphore
